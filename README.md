# Web-APIs-with-Python-and-Flask
Creating Web APIs with Python and Flask

#### Requirements
- Python3
- Flask `pip install flask`

#### Introducing API
Application Programming Interface (API) allows information to be manipulated by other programs via the internet.If you have data you wish to share with the world, an API is one way.

### API Terminology
- **HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** : is the primary means of communicating data on the web. HTTP implements a number of "methods", which tells which direction the data is moving and what should happen to it. The two most common are GET, which pulls data from a server and POST, which pushes data to a server.
- **URL(Uniform Resource Locator)** : An address for a resource on the web. A URL consists of a **protocol**`(http://)`, **domain**`(naikshubham.com)` , and optional **path** `(/about)`. A URL describes the location of a specific resource, such as a web page.
- **JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)** is a text-based data storage format that is designed to be easy to read for both humans and machines. JSON is generally the most common format for returning data through an API, XML being the second most common.
- **REST(REpresentational State Transfer)** is a philosophy that describes some best practices for implementing APIs. APIs designed with some or all of these principles in mind are called **REST APIs**.
